    <h3 id="pagebreak">Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</h3>
    <h5 id ="aidefinition">Definition</h5>
    <p>Different articles have varieties of definition about Artificial Intelligent but for this document we have selected the following two definitions to give readers general idea.  Techopedia.com defines Artificial intelligence (AI) is an area of computer science that emphasizes the creation of intelligent machines that work and react like humans. Some of the activities computers with artificial intelligence are designed for include:</p> 
        <ul>
            <li>Speech recognition</li> 
            <li>Learning Planning</li> 
            <li>Problem solving </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of computer program or a machine to think and learn. It is also a field of study which tries to make computers "smart". They work on their own without being encoded with commands.</p>
        <h5 id ="aihistory">History</h5>
        <p>The term artificial intelligence was coined in 1956, but AI has become more popular today thanks to increased data volumes, advanced algorithms, and improvements in computing power and storage.
       <br> Early AI research in the 1950s explored topics like problem solving and symbolic methods. In the 1960s, the US Department of Defense took interest in this type of work and began training computers to mimic basic human reasoning. For example, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) completed street mapping projects in the 1970s. And DARPA produced intelligent personal assistants in 2003, long before Siri, Alexa or Cortana were household names.
        <br>This early work paved the way for the automation and formal reasoning that we see in computers today, including decision support systems and smart search systems that can be designed to complement and augment human abilities. 
        <br>The research about Artificial Intelligence was started long time ago even before 1950’s. However, the term AI is introduced in 1950’s. The following list of events are presented to show how  the evolution of AI is happened.</p>

        <h5>How Artificial Intelligence is being used</h5>

        <p> Now days every industry has a high demand for AI capabilities. AI is helping human being in almost every part of our lives. To mention some of uses includes:</p>

        <h4>Healthcare</h4>
        <p>AI applications can provide personalized medicine and X-ray readings. Personal health care assistants can act as life coaches, reminding you to take your pills, exercise or eat healthier. </p>

        <h4>Retail</h4>
        <p> AI provides virtual shopping capabilities that offer personalized recommendations and discuss purchase options with the consumer. Stock management and site layout technologies will also be improved with AI.</p>

        <h4>Manufacturing</h4>
        <p> AI can analyze factory IoT data as it streams from connected equipment to forecast expected load and demand using recurrent networks, a specific type of deep learning network used with sequence data.</p>

        <h4>Banking</h4>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence enhances the speed, precision and effectiveness of human efforts. In financial institutions, AI techniques can be used to identify which transactions are likely to be fraudulent, adopt fast and accurate credit scoring, as well as automate manually intense data management tasks.</p>

        <h4>Transport</h4>
        <p>Self-driving train, metro and cars are now available.</p>
        
        <h4>Helping difficult tasks</h4>
        <p>Some robotic systems are in progress to perform services like difficult surgeries, rescue during disaster, fire-fighting, pipe inspection, bomb disposal, exploration of dangerous/unknown environment.</p>

        <h5 id ="aibias">Forms of bias: how unintentional bias happens</h5>
        <p>Algorithmic bias, as defined by Wikipedia occurs when a computer system reflects the implicit values of the humans who are involved in coding, collecting, selecting, or using data to train the algorithm.  

        <br>Bias can enter into Artificial Intelligence as a result of pre-existing cultural, social, or institutional expectations; because of technical limitations of their design; or by being used in unanticipated contexts or by audiences who are not considered in the software's initial design.

        <br>And thus, the fundamental software principle of ‘garbage in, garbage out’ is born. Today, however, artificial intelligence (AI) has raised the stakes on the old conundrum, as the ‘garbage out’ from AI leads to appalling examples of bias.
 
        <br>For example, if you want to use AI to make recommendations on who best to hire, feed the algorithm data about successful candidates in the past, and it will compare those to current candidates and spit out its recommendations.
 
        <br>Just one problem. If the input data are biased – say, consisting of mostly young white males, then who will the AI recommend? You guessed it: mostly young white males.
 
        <br>Whether the AI algorithms are themselves biased is also an open question. “[Machine-learning algorithms] haven’t been optimized for any definition of fairness,” says Deirdre Mulligan, associate professor, UC Berkeley School of Information. “They have been optimized to do a task.”
 
        <br>Basically, if the data that the machine is fed contains unconscious bias, then the outcome of the machine learning will also contain that bias.
 
        <br>“It’s not that the programmer sits down and does this on purpose, it’s something that he or she just doesn’t know and that way, the algorithms of these outcomes become flawed.”
        </p>

        <h5 id="aidevelopers">Ways developers are working to overcome bias in artificial intelligence</h5>
        <p>It was previously thought that the purity of math would be the quick solution to easily overcoming bias. After all, a computer’s responses are just a physical process, and therefore should be unable unable to display bias. While the previous assumption was that AI would provide neutral data as a machine is incapable of developing a personal position on morality or ethical platforms, developers soon experienced the flaws in machine learning, and the pitfalls of algorithmic bias. Developers began searching for solutions to these various forms of bias, resulting in a series of changes, with some answers being simple, and others more complex.

        <br>One of the most simple ways developers are working to fight algorithmic bias is by overcoming the lack of diversity in the development community. A more diverse group of contributors can help fight unintentional bias by providing more varied perspectives when creating artificial intelligence. More diverse creators can lead to more diverse and inclusive data. An example of this would be the AI who when given the search word “engineer” displayed mostly caucasian males. Had more women been involved in the creating environment for this tech, the issue may have been caught quicker or may not occured at all. 

        <br>Another solution for writing unbiased algorithms is that developers are simply writing better code. As artificial intelligence gains popularity, developers are getting more experience in writing for AI and improving on anticipating common stumbling blocks based on previous issues and experiences. Developers now have higher standards, and better awareness when creating AI. The data is only as unbiased as the person creating it, and developers are now actively looking to make sure the data supplied is more diverse to match the diverse needs of the consumer. One of the most common ways this is being implemented is by improving testing systems. 

        <br>While a large part of bias in AI creation happens without premeditation, intentional bias can occur, both in the creative environment, and with the consumer. To counteract intentional bias forming in the production of AI, the programming community has been calling for a standard of quality control auditing to occur for AI software both prior to and post production. It is hoped that requiring all created AI software to be subject to the scrutiny of peers within the tech community may help deter any intentional bias that may occur as well as catch any potential overlooked algorithmic bias. 

        <br>Overcoming the bias of the consumer has proven to be a bit more tricky. User input affects machine learning dramatically, just ask anyone who used Twitter the day “TayTweets” was released. Developers are trying to creatively come up with solutions to account for and limit biased user data without overstepping the whole purpose, which is allowing the user to supply their own input. One of the ways this is being done is by compensating for cultural bias when writing code for AI. Artificially created systems reflect our society’s values. If you have an imperfect society providing data for machine learning, it’s no surprise the results of machine learning will ultimately reflect that culture’s various inherent forms of bias. Making sure AI systems are well trained on balanced data prior to being released for use helps combat the machine learning of cultural bias. Another option being considered and implemented is the policing and monitoring of AI software after it has been released. Observing AI in action and stepping in to take corrective measures when AI becomes too deviant from its intended purpose may help safeguard the integrity of the software.
